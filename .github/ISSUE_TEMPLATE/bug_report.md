#### Description
<!-- 
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
-->

#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
<!--
Please add a minimal example so that we can reproduce the error by running the
code. If possible, link to a PMML file (anonymized if necessary) that causes
problems, or does not yield expected results. In short, we are going to
copy-paste the code and we expect to get the same result as you.

If the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link
it in the issue: https://gist.github.com
-->

#### Expected Results
<!-- 
Paste or describe the expected output. For instance, share some input data and
corresponding prediction probabilities generated from the original model.
before converting the model to PMML. 
-->

#### Actual Results
<!-- 
In case of an error, please paste or specifically describe the actual output
or traceback.
-->

#### Versions
<!--
Please run the following snippet and paste the output below.
import platform; print(platform.platform())
import sys; print("Python", sys.version)
import numpy; print("NumPy", numpy.__version__)
import scipy; print("SciPy", scipy.__version__)
import sklearn; print("Scikit-Learn", sklearn.__version__)
import sklearn_pmml_model; print("sklearn-pmml-model", sklearn_pmml_model.__version__)
